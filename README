# husky-codegenerator

This is a code generator for the Husky library, helping to maintain part of the code. It's made of two
parts:

- An enum generator for the common value sets of the Swiss EPR. More details in the [wiki](https://gitlab.
  com/ehealth-connector/api/-/wikis/Updating-the-Swiss-EPR-metadata).
- A class and enum generator for the CDA-CH-EMED project. More details in the [wiki](https://gitlab.
  com/ehealth-connector/api/-/wikis/ART-DECOR-to-Java-Code-Generator).

When cloning the project, some classes will be missing (package `org.husky.codegenerator.cda.antlr`).
They are generated when compiling the Maven package (see the `antlr4-maven-plugin` plugin).
