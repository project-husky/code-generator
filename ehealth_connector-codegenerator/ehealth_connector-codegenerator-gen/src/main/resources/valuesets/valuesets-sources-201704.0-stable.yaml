# The base URL that is used to download the value sets in JSON.
# To this URL the "id" and "effectiveDate" is appended in the form

baseUrl: 'http://art-decor.org/decor/services/RetrieveValueSet?prefix=ch-epr-&format=json'

# The list of all configured value sets that will be generated from the CH-EPR value set
# repository (https://art-decor.org/art-decor/decor-valuesets--ch-epr-)
#
# Required fields for each item in the list are:
#  id:              The unique OID of the value set (CODE_SYSTEM_OID)
#  projectFolder:   The base folder where the project containing the enum Java class can be found
#  className:       The fully qualified class name of the enum class that will be generated/overwritten
#  effectiveDate:   The date and time stamp of the version to download from the CH-EPR repository
#  codeSystemName:  The code system name that should be set (CODE_SYSTEM_NAME)
#
# The generator will first look if there is a file called
# src/main/resources/generateValueSets/<codeSystemName>.json
# If the file exists, that file is used to generate the Java code of the enum. Otherwise the file
# is downloaded from the repository using the baseUrl, id and effectiveDate and then stored
# at the previously mentioned location for future usage.
